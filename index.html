										<h2>About</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Growing up in the picturesque rural landscapes of Oregon, I spent most of my time outdoors with my family, running in pastures, swimming in the creek by our house, and hiking through forestland. My dad's passion for nature and love for people had a significant influence on me, which is reflected in my photography.</p>
									<p>I have always enjoyed working closely with people and cherish the process of getting to know each person on a personal level. I find the creative journey of finding the perfect location for each shoot to be an exciting experience. My preference is for shooting in natural light to capture the authenticity of the moment.</p>
									<p>I am married to a wonderful man who is both beautiful inside and out. My lovely daughters are not always thrilled about being photographed, but they still let me capture their moments. My two sweet grandchildren, Gwenevere and Jack, also inspire my work.</p>
									<p>In addition to my passion for photography, I am a licensed massage therapist, and have been practicing since 1996. My focus is on helping people with chronic pain issues, injuries, and maintenance programs for a better quality of life. I also work with veterans to help guide them on their journey to live pain-free. I am deeply committed to both my work as a massage therapist and photographer, and I look forward to collaborating with you soon!</p>
